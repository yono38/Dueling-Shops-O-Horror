##Summary

A two player, strategy based game inspired by popular carnival water-gun game# combined with a “Prisoner’s Dilemma” type bombing game

##Objective
Players compete to “water” their assigned venus flytrap bud by directing a laser-pointer at its photoresistor outfitted center, while also racing to covertly defend their plant from “bombing attacks” triggered by a button hidden within the base of their plant. 

##Mechanics of the “bombing game”
Each round of the game is initiated when the first player presses their button. The other player will have 5 seconds to respond, but cannot respond while they are watering their plant. The original player can keep watering after pressing the button, but it will nullify their choice and they have to press it again before the end of the round.

Each player is limited to 5 defends.

###Rules of game:
* Bomb-Bomb: both players lose 1 health 
* Bomb-Defend: bombing player loses 1 health
* Defend-Defend: no change

##Interface
Each plant will include a photoresistor positioned within its mouth and two control buttons hidden within its base to allow the player to defend against or deploy bombing attacks against their opponent.  Three LEDs planted beside the sprout will be used to denote its “health” level while a fourth LED will light to indicate the status of the opponent’s “bomb” attacks.
